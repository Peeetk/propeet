        <p>I think I was overthinking this project at first. I did not understand what is really needed to put together, but luckily I have a really good mentor, his name is Nathen who was helping me a lot to discrbibe what is job actually.</p>

        <p>I was thinking a lot what is the best way to put together a web page. Should I make the html first then add the style after, or make them in the same time. Finally I have decided to work on both html and css and same time.</p>

         <p> It was little but confusing how, why and what is not working, but then it all came together.</p>

         <p>I have used some examples from codecademy and pics from internet, but most of the work is from me.</p>

        <p>I really hope that this job is meating whit all the criteria.</p>
